# Binding

A binding connects an identifier to a dependency item. The injector uses bindings to know what to provide when a dependency is requested.

## Registering Bindings

### In the Constructor

The most common way is to pass bindings when creating the injector:

```ts
const injector = new Injector([
  [AuthService],                              // Class as both identifier and item
  [ILogger, { useClass: ConsoleLogger }],     // Interface → Class
  [IConfig, { useValue: { debug: true } }],   // Interface → Value
  [IFactory, { useFactory: () => create() }], // Interface → Factory
]);
```

### Using the `add` Method

You can also add bindings later:

```ts
const injector = new Injector();

injector.add([AuthService]);
injector.add([ILogger, { useClass: ConsoleLogger }]);
```

<Callout>
  Be careful with `add` — make sure bindings are registered before they are requested, or you'll get an error.
</Callout>

## Modifying Bindings

### Replace a Binding

```ts
injector.replace([ILogger, { useClass: FileLogger }]);
```

### Delete a Binding

```ts
injector.delete(ILogger);
```

<Callout type="warning">
  You can only replace or delete bindings **before** they are resolved. Once a dependency has been created, changes won't take effect.
