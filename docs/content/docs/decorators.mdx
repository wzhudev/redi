# Decorators Overview

redi provides parameter decorators to declare and configure dependencies. Here's a quick reference.

## Injection Decorators

Declare what dependencies should be injected. See [Declare Dependency](/docs/declare-dependency) for details.

| Decorator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [`@Inject(id)`](/docs/declare-dependency) | Inject a required dependency |
| [`@Optional(id?)`](/docs/declare-dependency) | Inject an optional dependency (returns `null` if not found) |
| [`@Many(id?)`](/docs/declare-dependency) | Inject all instances as an array |

## Lookup Decorators

Control where dependencies are resolved. See [Hierarchy Injection](/docs/hierarchy) for details.

| Decorator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [`@Self()`](/docs/hierarchy) | Only look in current injector |
| [`@SkipSelf()`](/docs/hierarchy) | Skip current, look in parent |
| [`@InjectSelf()`](/docs/inject-self) | Inject the Injector itself |

## Behavior Decorators

Modify how dependencies are resolved.

| Decorator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [`@WithNew()`](/docs/with-new) | Create a new instance (skip singleton cache) |

<Callout>
  Most decorators can be combined. For example: `@SkipSelf() @Optional(IConfig)` looks for an optional dependency only in parent injectors.
