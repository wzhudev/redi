# Getting started

<Callout>
  It is highly recommended to learn a thing or two about dependency injection
  before moving on.
</Callout>

## Installation

Inside your project, run the following:

```shell npm2yarn
npm install @wendellhu/redi
```

After installation, you should enable `experimentalDecorators` in the tsconfig.json file:

```json highlight=3
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  }
}
```

## Basic usage

Let's get started with an example:

```tsx
class AuthService {
  public static getCurrentUserInfo(): UserInfo {
    // your implementation here...
  }
}

class FileListService {
  constructor() {}

  public getUserFiles(): Promise<Files> {
    const currentUser = AuthService.getCurrentUserInfo();
    // ...
  }
}
```

Obviously `FileListService` depends on `AuthService`. Let's see how we can make this piece of code dependency injection flavour.

**Step One. Declare dependency relationship.**

```typescript highlight=1,4,10,13
import { Inject } from "@wendellhu/redi";

class AuthService {
  public getCurrentUserInfo(): UserInfo {
    // your implementation here...
  }
}

class FileListService {
  constructor(@Inject(AuthService) private readonly authService: AuthService) {}

  public getUserFiles(): Promise<Files> {
    const currentUser = this.authService.getCurrentUserInfo();
    // ...
  }
}
```

Use the decorator `Inject` to declare on the constructor of `FileListService` that `AuthService` is one of its dependencies.

**Step Two: Provide dependencies.**

```typescript
import { Injector } from "@wendellhu/redi";

const injector = new Injector([[FileListService], [AuthService]]);
```

All your have to do is pass them into the constructor of `Injector`.

**Step Three. Wire up.**

```typescript
const fileListService = injector.get(FileListService);
```

Then you get an instance of `FileListService`, and its dependency `AuthService` is also constructed and cached in the `Injector.

```typescript
const authService = injector.get(FileListService);
```

Read the [next chapter](/en-US/docs/concepts) to learn basic concepts in dependency injection.

## Using redi with CDN

You can also use redi via CDN if you don't want to use npm or yarn.

Include the following `<script>` tag in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@wendellhu/redi/dist/umd/index.js"></script>
```

Redi will be mounted on the global variable `@wendellhu/redi`, and you can access it via `window["@wendellhu/redi"]`.

<Callout>
  Here we use [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com) as the CDN service. You can also choose other CDN services that host npm packages, such as [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com).
</Callout>

If you want to use redi with React, you can include the following `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@wendellhu/redi/dist/umd/react-bindings/index.js"></script>
```

Redi's React API will be mounted on the global variable `@wendellhu/redi/react-bindings`, and you can access it via `window["@wendellhu/redi/react-bindings"]`.

If you are using React 19, you should import the React bindings using [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules):

```html
<script type="module">
  import { Inject, Injector } from "https://unpkg.com/@wendellhu/redi/dist/esm/index.js";
  import { connectDependencies } from "https://unpkg.com/@wendellhu/redi/dist/esm/react-bindings/index.js";
</script>
```
