# redi 1.0 released

redi has reached version 1.0!

What has changed? Basically, nothing. I just removed some deprecated features and refined the documentation. The core functionality remains the same, and you can continue to use redi as you have been. Add I managed to have all code covered by tests.

**redi's API is now stable**, and we are committed to maintaining backward compatibility in future releases.

## Removed API

**`useDependencyValue`, `useDependencyContext` and `useDependencyContextValue` has been removed.** Please use `useObservable` instead. In the recent React versions, it will not cause unnecessary re-renders anymore.
